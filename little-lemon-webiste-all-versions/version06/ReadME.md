By working through the lessons in this course, you have learned the necessary skills and knowledge to develop a home page for a fictional client. 

Using your new knowledge of HTML and CSS you need to create a semantic structure with a header, main content and footer. Decide between a grid or flexbox for your layout. The client’s logo needs to be in the header and the main content needs to have a large promotional banner and three columns with text and images below it. The footer should have two columns. The first column must contain a smaller version of the logo and the second column should have copywriting information. 

In terms of styling, you should use your creativity to create the appropriate look and feel to capture the attention of the client’s target audience. You should use your knowledge about CSS selectors and effects to create the appropriate intentional engagement that would serve your client best.

More detailed criteria are covered in the Grading Criteria Overview below. 

To choose a client, read more about the four fictional clients in the Subject  reading.

Still have some questions? The reading About the graded assessment provides answers to typical questions. The videos about Selecting the subject, Positioning the elements, creating placeholders and Planning the user experience offer valuable guidance on how to approach the project.

Review criteria
less 
When you submit your assignment, other learners in the course will review and grade your work. They will be looking for the following:

Visual layout

When viewing the home page in the browser:

Is it clear that this is a home page for one of the four fictional clients?

Is the correct company logo at the top of the page?

Is there a horizontal navigation menu with four links below the logo?

Does one of the links in the navigation menu link to the home page itself?

Does the main content contain a large promotional banner at the top and three columns below it, each containing an image and some text?

Does the page have a footer that is split into two columns?

Does the left column of the footer contain a small version of the client logo and the right column copyright text?

Semantic structure

When opening the HTML file in VS Code, does it contain:

A header element for the logo?

A nav element for the navigation menu?

A main element for the content?

A footer element for the footer?

Appropriate usage of other semantic tags such as article and section in the content of the main element?

  

CSS layout, styling and effects

When viewing the home page in the browser:

Is the use of CSS styling effective?

Is CSS used to create appropriate interactivity?

When opening the CSS file in VS code, ask yourself the following:

Is it a grid or flexbox layout?

Does it have the appropriate selectors to style elements?

Does it specify any pseudo-classes to create interactivity on the home page?

Are any animations or transition effects used? Do they improve the user experience or distract from it?

Overall effect of the home page

Does the home page create adequate interaction and a pleasing visual experience that is fitting for the client and its customers? 

Are CSS styling and effects used effectively to create intentional engagement? 

What works well? 

What advice can you give to improve the user experience, layout and visuals of the home page?

You'll also need to give feedback on and grade the assignments of two other learners using the same criteria.

How to create and submit your assignment
less 
You need to develop your home page by creating an HTML file called index.html and a CSS file called style.css. You can develop these pages using VS Code on your local machine or in the UGL Project sandbox provided earlier in this lesson. The reading Setting up your local development environment provides the steps on how to set up VS Code on your computer if your choose to do so. 

If you plan on using the UGL sandbox, your work will only be available during that session. Take note that the Project Sandbox only allows you to work for one hour at a time. Make sure you download your files before exiting the UGL. To work on your project again later, you can simply open the HTML and CSS files on your local machine and copy and paste the code again into the template files in the Project Sandbox. Remember to download the edited versions again at the end of the session.

To submit your project you need to download your files to your local machine by right-clicking on them in the Explorer panel and selecting "Download".

You will be required to submit your home page by uploading a zipped project folder that contains your HTML and CSS file. To learn more about how to zip and unzip folders visit the Mac or Windows support page.

      

How to review
less 
Once you have submitted your project folder you are required to review two peer submissions. Before you start, review the exemplar 'so far so good' video in your learning pathway.  Next, view the peers that you need to review in the “Peers to review” section. You need to download their zipped project folders, unzip them and view the HTML files in your browser. 

You also have to open their HTML and CSS files to inspect the code. You can do this either by opening it in VS code or any local text editor. Alternatively, you can copy and paste their code into new files in the UGL Project sandbox mentioned earlier in this lesson.


Examples of Good Feedback
less 
As a reviewer, you will be required to provide feedback on assignments submitted by two of your peers.

The focus of your feedback should be on the use of semantics, the layout and the CSS styling and effects.

The strong home page takes advantage of the HTML semantics and CSS layout, styling and effects covered in this course to create a structured home page where:

The HTML and CSS code are correctly formatted and valid

The required layout is accomplished and creates a pleasing impression

The page is semantically described using appropriate semantic HTML tags

The HTML head element contains appropriate meta tags

CSS selectors are not over-specific and the layout is achieved using minimal selectors and rules

The styling is coherent and pleasing to the eye

Intentional engagement is evident through the placement of promotions or products

CSS effects and animations are complimentary to the design and not distracting

The required layout is accomplished and creates a pleasing impression 

Effective interactivity is created with effects

The correct HTML semantics are used to give the correct structure to the HTML file

The CSS styling is coherent and pleasing to the eye

Intentional engagement is evident

  

On the weak home page

 The layout is not executed as required

The HTML and CSS code is poorly formatted and/or contains errors

The HTML head element is missing meta tags

The page does not make use of semantic HTML tags

CSS selectors are over-specific

The styling is displeasing to the eye

CSS effects and animations are distracting to the viewer

The layout is not executed as required

The CSS styling is not used optimally to create a suitable visual effect for the client

The CSS selectors were not used correctly

The effects were limited and could be utilized more effectively

There were errors in the semantic structure of the HTML file
